# Multivariate Weather Forecasting with LSTM

## Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for accurate multivariate weather forecasting. The model will utilize historical weather data to predict multiple weather variables (e.g., temperature, humidity) for a specified future horizon. The project has applications in agricultural planning, energy demand prediction, and disaster preparedness.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to enhance weather forecasting capabilities by effectively capturing complex temporal relationships within historical weather data and utilizing past observations of various weather metrics to predict future values.

## Key Features
- LSTM-based deep learning model for multivariate weather forecasting.
- Prediction of multiple weather variables simultaneously.
- Capture complex temporal patterns in historical weather data.
- Ability to forecast future values for a specified horizon.
- Applications in agricultural planning, energy demand prediction, and disaster preparedness.
